**BBcore** Portage overlay

## Introduction

This [Portage](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Portage) overlay contains ebuilds
that can be used to replace as much of a typical GNU/Linux OS as possible with
BusyBox applets.

Some ebuilds are original to this repo; some others are borrowed from others
(maily the Gentoo repo) and modified as needed.
